# blackjack

This is a quick project C we had to make in school in one week. There is no commit history since I changed the name of the repo.

The game contains 1-7 players that are given a name. The players will be given a set of money and the game will be played until there is no players left in the table.
The goal is to have as much money as possible.

There are doubling or splitting is possible if the player has money for it and for splitting the pair of cards with the same value. Splitting can be only done once.
A player can leave the table at the start of a hand.

Every move will be recorded to a log file that can be printed in the menu.

Here is on example how a hand would be played:
